This is my personal website under the n1ghtg1de handle.

## About Me
I’m learning offensive security and documenting my journey. Here I post:
- Labs and practice from CRTA, eCPPT, and similar courses
- Small tools, scripts, and experiments I try out
- Notes from my hands-on practice

## What I’m Focusing On
- Active Directory basics
- Internal network attacks
- Web exploitation
- Building a solid Red Team foundation

## Why This Site Exists
To track my progress, keep my notes organized, and gradually move from labs to real-world skills.

## Status
Learning in progress, updated regularly.
